Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete\\n\\n**Benefits of creating a todo/task_progress list now:**\\n\\t- Clear roadmap for implementation\\n\\t- Progress tracking throughout the task\\n\\t- Nothing gets forgotten or missed\\n\\t- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan\\n\\n**Example structure:**```\\n- [ ] Analyze requirements\\n- [ ] Set up necessary files\\n- [ ] Implement main functionality\\n- [ ] Handle edge cases\\n- [ ] Test the implementation\\n- [ ] Verify results```\\n\\nKeeping the task_progress list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is

Let me summarize the architecture:\n\n## Architecture Summary:\n\n### GameAction System:\n1. **GameAction.cs** - Abstract base class with:\n   - PreReactions\n   - PerformReactions\n   - PostReactions\n\n2. **ActionSystem.cs** - Singleton that manages:   - `Perform(GameAction)` - Entry point to execute an action\n   - `Flow(GameAction)` - Executes PreReactions → Performer → PostReactions\n   - `AttachPerformer<T>` - Registers a performer for a GameAction type\n   - `DetachPerformer<T>` - Unregisters a performer\n   - `SubscribeReaction<T>` - Subscribe to PRE/POST reactions\n   - `UnsubscribeReaction<T>` - Unsubscribe from reactions\n   - `AddReaction(GameAction)` - Adds a reaction to the current action\n\n3. **Pattern for each GameAction**:\n   - **<Action>GA.cs** - Defines the GameAction with properties\n   - **<Action>System.cs** - MonoBehaviour that attaches performer in OnEnable\n\n### Current GameActions:\n- DrawCardGA/DrawCardSystem\n- PlayCardGA/PlayCardSystem\n- EndTurnGA/EndTurnSystem\n\n### Card Data Structure:\n- name, id, type, power, description, attackmod, defensemod, healthmod, effect\n\n### Network:\n- Uses Unity.Netcode (NetworkVariable, NetworkBehaviour)\n- Singleton extends NetworkBehaviour\n- Turn tracking uses NetworkVariable<ulong>\n\n## What I need to implement:\n\n1. **Network Security Assessment** - The current implementation uses NetworkVariables which are reasonably secure for peer-to-peer play. The turn system and action system are decoupled enough to be modular.\n\n2. **New Game Actions**:\n   - **BeginTurnGA/BeginTurnSystem** - Corresponding action to EndTurn\n   - **DiscardCardGA/DiscardCardSystem** - Move card from hand to discard\n   - **DestroyCardGA/DestroyCardSystem** - Remove card from play (different from discard)\n   - **ModifyCardGA/ModifyCardSystem** - Change card stats temporarily\n   - **ActivateAbilityGA/ActivateAbilitySystem** - Trigger card ability\n   - **EditCardGA/EditCardSystem** - Permanently modify card data\n\n3. **Test Cards for JSON** - Need sample card data to validate the structure\n\nI'll implement these new actions following the established pattern, ensuring each has its corresponding GA and System files with proper performer registration.","partial":false,"modelInfo":{"providerId":"anthropic","modelId":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","mode":"act"},"conversationHistoryIndex":32},{"ts":1769064672569,"type":"say","say":"text","text":"Now I have a complete understanding of the architecture.

Here's a summary:\n\n**New Game Actions Implemented (12 new files):**\n- **BeginTurnGA/BeginTurnSystem**: Triggers at the start of each player's turn, enabling \"on turn start\" card abilities\n- **DiscardCardGA/DiscardCardSystem**: Moves cards from hand to discard pile with source tracking\n- **DestroyCardGA/DestroyCardSystem**: Removes cards from board to scrap pile, separate from discard\n- **ModifyCardGA/ModifyCardSystem**: Applies temporary stat modifications with duration tracking\n- **ActivateAbilityGA/ActivateAbilitySystem**: Executes card abilities with extensible handler system\n- **EditCardGA/EditCardSystem**: Permanently modifies card properties including card transformation\n\n**All new actions meet the requirements:**\n1. Use Unity.Netcode exclusively (no new network dependencies)\n2. Can be called/attached as reactions with 1-3 lines of code (e.g., `ActionSystem.Instance.AddReaction(new DiscardCardGA(card, playerId))`)\n3. Are referenceable by other game actions via the ActionSystem subscription system\n\n**Additional Updates:**\n- Added 11 test cards to CardDataJSON.txt (IDs 8-18) demonstrating each new GameAction\n- Updated EndTurnSystem to properly trigger BeginTurn for turn cycling\n- Fixed a bug in PlayCardSystem (was detaching wrong performer)\n- Created NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md documenting security measures and modularity guidelines\n\nThe architecture uses a flow pattern (PreReactions → Performer → PostReactions) that allows cards to easily react to any game action, making future mechanic implementation straightforward.HAS_CHANGES","modelInfo":{"providerId":"anthropic","modelId":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","mode":"act"},"conversationHistoryIndex":71,"lastCheckpointHash":"f35009af1b777d96fc17d86b311dba80ae4f4f0e"},{"ts":1769066943749,"type":"say","say":"task_progress","text":"- [x] Analyze existing codebase architecture\n- [x] Assess network security and modularity\n- [x] Implement new game actions\n  - [x] BeginTurnGA + BeginTurnSystem\n  - [x] DiscardCardGA + DiscardCardSystem\n  - [x] DestroyCardGA + DestroyCardSystem\n  - [x] ModifyCardGA + ModifyCardSystem\n  - [x] ActivateAbilityGA + ActivateAbilitySystem\n  - [x] EditCardGA + EditCardSystem\n- [x] Add test cards to JSON for each new game action\n- [x] Update EndTurnSystem to trigger BeginTurn\n- [x] Fix PlayCardSystem bug\n- [x] Add network security documentation\n- [x] Verify implementation meets requirements","modelInfo":{"providerId":"anthropic","modelId":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","mode":"act"},"conversationHistoryIndex":71},{"ts":1769066943804,"type":"ask","ask":"completion_result","text":"","conversationHistoryIndex":71},{"ts":1769067043918,"type":"ask","ask":"resume_completed_task","conversationHistoryIndex":71}]
